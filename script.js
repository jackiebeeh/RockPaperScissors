//Rock Paper Scissors

// create a function named getComputerChoice.
// make it choose randomly from an array of items called "Rock","Paper" and "Scissors"
//
//Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. 
//The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection
// - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so:
// "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
//Make your functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive 
//(so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
//
//create a function named playerSelection that returns a string from the input the user makes.
//The user input should be case insesitive
//
//create a funtion that takes both the player input and the computer choice as parameters and returns the results of game as a string.
//Result options:
//You WIN!!! playersChoice beats Computers choice.
//You lose! ComputersChoice beats players choice.
//
//rock vs paper = paper
//rock vs scissors = rock
//paper vs scissors = scissors
